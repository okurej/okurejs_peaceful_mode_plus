# okurejs_peaceful_mode_plus
**Okurej's Peaceful Mode+** is a quality-of-life data pack for peaceful-mode Minecraft. It aims to make every normally obtainable resource in survival Minecraft possible to obtain on peaceful difficulty, and also introduces some other quality-of-life tweaks which can be read about in the Wiki.

This data pack was uploaded to GitHub only by request of a friend of mine. As I do not play Minecraft very often, this data pack does not recieve regular updates; however, I may sometimes update this pack by special request.

Not every feature included in this pack is my idea; many of the recipes and other features were modified from other, similar packs. You can also view the credits in the Wiki.
